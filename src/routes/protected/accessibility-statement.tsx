        <p>
          This project is committed to delivering an excellent user experience
          for everyone. Equalify's user interface is structured in a way that
          allows those of all abilities to easily and quickly find the
          information they need.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold">Ongoing Efforts to Ensure Accessible Content</h2>
        <p>
          Equalify uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version
          2.2 as its guiding principle. As we develop new pages and
          functionality, the principles of accessible design and development are
          an integral part of conception and realization.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continually test content and features for WCAG 2.2 Level AA
          compliance and remediate any issues to ensure we meet or exceed the
          standards. Testing of our digital content is performed by our
          accessibility experts using automated testing software, screen
          readers, a color contrast analyzer, and keyboard-only navigation
          techniques.
        </p>
